Title: Code Refractor

What? The expectation was to change the exiting code with new code that we learnt during the past one week making sure the results are exaclty the same.

Why? To be able to solve one problem in different ways and to realize there are multiple solutions to any problem.

How? This exercise was indeed very tedious and based on hit and try method and at last to realize how many ways I could use the different codes to reach to the same destination

Thank you!
